# release-log

A library to programmatically generate changelogs from git history and conventional commits.
This tool helps automate the process of creating and maintaining `CHANGELOG.md` files by parsing commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Features

*   **Conventional Commits Parsing:** Understands standard conventional commit types (feat, fix, chore, etc.).
*   **Tag-Based Changelogs:**
    *   Generate changelog for a specific tag range (e.g., `v1.0.0..v1.1.0`).
    *   Generate changelog for a single release (e.g., all commits up to `v1.0.0`).
    *   Generate changelog for the latest release by default.
*   **Unreleased Changes:** Generate a section for "Unreleased" changes since the last tag or a specific tag.
*   **Customizable Commit Types:** Define custom commit types or override default section titles (e.g., map `feat` to "‚ú® New Features").
*   **JIRA Integration:**
    *   Automatically extracts JIRA ticket IDs (e.g., `PROJ-123`) from commit messages.
    *   Appends JIRA ID to commit messages in the changelog if not already present.
    *   Deduplicates entries based on JIRA ticket ID, keeping the message from the oldest commit for that ticket.
*   **GitHub Integration:** Generates links to commits if a `githubRepoUrl` is provided.
*   **File Operations:**
    *   Optionally save the generated changelog to a file.
    *   Prepends new content to the existing changelog file.
*   **Robust Handling:**
    *   Flexible tag filtering using a `tagFilter` function (defaults to ignoring tags ending with `-schema`).
    *   Gracefully handles repositories with no tags, no commits, or no conventional commits within a range.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Highly configurable to suit various project needs.
*   **Preset Support:** Supports presets for changelog generation, starting with the `angular` preset, which formats changelogs according to Angular conventions, including a dedicated "BREAKING CHANGES" section.

## Installation

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add release-log
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
const { generateChangelog } = require('release-log');

async function createChangelog() {
  try {
    // Generate changelog for the latest release (commits between the last two tags)
    const changelogContent = await generateChangelog({
      repoPath: '/path/to/your/git/repository', // Defaults to process.cwd()
      githubRepoUrl: 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo' // For commit links
    });
    console.log(changelogContent);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to generate changelog:', error);
  }
}

createChangelog();
```

### Advanced Example: Unreleased Changes, Custom Tag Filter, and Saving to File

```javascript
const { generateChangelog } = require('release-log');

async function updateMyChangelog() {
  try {
    const changelogContent = await generateChangelog({
      repoPath: process.cwd(),
      unreleased: true, // Generate for unreleased changes since the latest tag
      // fromTag: 'v1.2.0', // Optionally specify a base tag for unreleased changes
      save: true,
      changelogFile: 'CHANGELOG.md', // File to save to (relative to repoPath)
      githubRepoUrl: 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo',
      // preset: 'angular', // Uncomment to use the Angular preset
      // commitTypes are typically overridden by the preset if 'angular' is active.
      // If no preset is active, or if the preset doesn't define specific types, these can be used.
      commitTypes: { 
        feat: 'üöÄ New Features & Enhancements',
        fix: 'üêõ Bug Fixes',
        perf: '‚ö° Performance Improvements',
        // other custom types or overrides
      },
      tagFilter: (tag) => /^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/.test(tag) // Only consider tags like v1.0.0, v0.2.1, etc.
    });
    console.log('Changelog updated successfully!');
    // console.log(changelogContent); // Contains the newly generated section
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update changelog:', error);
  }
}

updateMyChangelog();
```

## Configuration Options (API)

The `generateChangelog` function accepts an options object with the following properties:

| Option          | Type                               | Default                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `repoPath`      | `string`                           | `process.cwd()`                                              | Path to the git repository.                                                                                                                                              |
| `fromTag`       | `string \| null`                   | `null`                                                       | The git tag to start the changelog from (exclusive). If `unreleased` is true, this is the tag to compare HEAD against. If `null` & `unreleased`, uses the latest tag.      |
| `toTag`         | `string \| null`                   | `null`                                                       | The git tag to end the changelog at (inclusive). Ignored if `unreleased` is true. If `null` & not `unreleased`, uses the latest tag.                                      |
| `unreleased`    | `boolean`                          | `false`                                                      | If true, generates changelog for commits since `fromTag` (or latest tag if `fromTag` is `null`) up to HEAD. The title will be "# Unreleased".                         |
| `save`          | `boolean`                          | `false`                                                      | If true, saves the generated changelog by prepending it to the specified file.                                                                                           |
| `changelogFile` | `string`                           | `'CHANGELOG.md'`                                             | File path to save/update the changelog. Used if `save` is true. Relative to `repoPath` if not absolute.                                                                 |
| `commitTypes`   | `Record<string, string>`           | See [Default Commit Types](#default-commit-types)            | Custom mapping of commit type prefixes (e.g., 'feat', 'fix') to section titles (e.g., 'Features', 'Bug Fixes'). Merged with defaults, custom values override. |
| `githubRepoUrl` | `string \| null`                   | `null`                                                       | Base URL of the GitHub repository (e.g., "https://github.com/owner/repo") to generate links for commit hashes. If `null`, links are not generated.                    |
| `tagFilter`     | `(tag: string) => boolean`         | `(tag) => tag && !tag.endsWith('-schema')`                   | A function that receives a tag string and returns `true` if the tag should be included in versioning, `false` otherwise.                                             |
| `preset`        | `string \| null`                   | `null`                                                       | Specifies a preset to use for changelog generation. Currently supported: `'angular'`. When a preset is active, it may override default `commitTypes` and formatting rules. |

## Presets

The `preset` option allows you to use predefined configurations for generating changelogs, tailored to specific project conventions.

### Angular Preset

When you set `preset: 'angular'`, the changelog will be formatted according to the conventions used by the [Angular project](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). This preset typically includes sections such as Features (‚ú®), Bug Fixes (üêõ), Performance Improvements (‚ö°Ô∏è), and importantly, a dedicated "BREAKING CHANGES" section at the top.

**Commit Message Conventions for Angular Preset:**

The Angular preset relies heavily on commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification, with specific attention to how breaking changes are denoted.

*   **Standard Structure:** `type(scope): subject`
*   **Breaking Changes:** To denote a breaking change, the commit body **must** include a footer starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `BREAKING-CHANGE:` (case-insensitive), followed by a detailed description of the change.

    Example of a commit with a breaking change:
    ```
    feat(api): implement new user endpoint

    This commit introduces the new `/users` endpoint.

    BREAKING CHANGE: The previous `/user/profiles` endpoint is now deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.0.
    Please migrate to the new `/users` endpoint.
    ```

    Commits marked this way will have their breaking change notes extracted and displayed prominently in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section at the top of the generated changelog for that release. The original commit will also appear under its respective type (e.g., "Features").

## Conventional Commits

This library relies on commit messages following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
A typical commit message looks like:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example:
`feat(api): add new endpoint for user profiles PROJ-456`
`fix: correct calculation error in payment module JIRA-123`

## Default Commit Types

The following commit types are recognized by default and mapped to these section titles in the changelog:

| Type       | Default Section Title    |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `feat`     | Features                 |
| `fix`      | Bug Fixes                |
| `docs`     | Documentation            |
| `style`    | Styles                   |
| `refactor` | Code Refactoring         |
| `perf`     | Performance Improvements |
| `test`     | Tests                    |
| `build`    | Build System             |
| `ci`       | CI                       |
| `chore`    | Chores                   |
| `revert`   | Reverts                  |

You can customize these titles or add new types using the `commitTypes` option. Custom types will be sorted alphabetically after the default types.
**Note:** If a `preset` is used (e.g., `'angular'`), it will typically define its own set of commit types and section titles, which would take precedence over these defaults and any custom `commitTypes` provided.
